# Roadmap

## In progress
- Android "Connection and Sync Status" feature (per `.claude/agents/android-ui-bee.md`
  and `integration-sync-bee.md`):
  - Done: `StatusRepository`, `ConnectionStatus` enum, and connection-state derivation
    from Firebase exceptions already exist in `Core.kt`.
  - Not done: `ConnectionStatusScreen.kt` UI (indicators, Test Connection button,
    loading/success/error states) not found in the repo — no file matching
    `ConnectionStatusScreen` under `mobile-android/`.
  - Not done: read-only lightweight reachability check against Firestore
    (`integration-sync-bee`'s scope) — presence not verified this session; re-check
    `Core.kt` for a dedicated Test Connection method before assuming it's missing vs.
    just not yet named that way.

## Blocked
- Google Calendar going fully live: blocked on manual Google Cloud OAuth client
  creation/consent-screen configuration per `docs/GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP.md` — the code
  is complete but real-world OAuth has not been verified.

## Completed (verified in code, not just claimed)
- Firebase-direct Firestore CRUD for web and Android (clients, machines, service
  records, job cards, users, permissions).
- Google Calendar Cloud Functions backend + frontend + Android read-only consumer.

## Deferred / explicitly not being pursued
- Laravel parity for Google Calendar and other Firestore-backed resources — Laravel
  code kept in the repo but not actively maintained as a client-facing path.
